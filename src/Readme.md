# `src` Directory Overview

The `src` directory contains the core codebase for the application. This includes utility functions, application logic, components, resources like styles and themes, and server-side logic. It serves as the heart of the project, organizing code in a modular and maintainable structure.

## Folder Structure
### Detailed Breakdown

#### `/src/_utils/`
- This folder contains reusable utility functions, helper methods, or constants that can be shared across the application.
- Utility functions should be pure and modular, ensuring they can be used anywhere in the app without side effects.

#### `/src/app/`
- The `app` directory houses the main application logic and pages (especially in a Next.js environment). It is responsible for handling routing and server-side rendering.
- Pages and components defined here are rendered as different routes in the application, ensuring a smooth user experience.

#### `/src/components/`
- This directory includes reusable UI components that are shared across the application. 
- Components can be as simple as buttons and form elements or more complex elements like navigation bars and modals.
- Structuring components in a modular way ensures consistency in the design and behavior throughout the app.

#### `/src/resources/`
- The `resources` folder stores assets such as global styles (`globals.css`), themes (`theme.ts`), and type definitions (`types.ts`). 
- By centralizing these files, you ensure consistent styling and theming across the application.
- This folder also allows the separation of concerns between business logic and design.

#### `/src/server/`
- This directory is responsible for server-side logic, which may include handling API routes, authentication, database interactions, or other backend tasks.
- For Next.js projects, this can contain files related to server-side API routes, authentication handlers, etc.

#### `/src/middleware.ts`
- The `middleware.ts` file includes custom middleware functions that are executed on every request before reaching the API routes or application logic.
- Middleware is used for tasks such as authentication, logging, and modifying requests or responses.

## Key Features

- **Modular Structure**: Each folder in the `src` directory is organized by responsibility, ensuring clean separation of concerns.
- **Reusability**: Components and utilities are reusable across different parts of the application, reducing redundancy and improving maintainability.
- **Scalability**: The structure supports scaling the application by adding new features, routes, and components without major restructuring.
- **Centralized Resources**: Global styles, themes, and utility types are kept in the `resources` folder to ensure a unified look and consistent behavior across the application.

## How to Customize

- **Adding New Pages/Routes**: To add new pages or routes, create new components or views in the `app` folder, and they will automatically be routed (if using Next.js).
- **Extending Components**: To add new UI components, create reusable components in the `components` folder and use them throughout your app.
- **Adding Utilities**: Place any new helper functions or constants in the `_utils` folder to maintain a clean codebase and avoid duplicate logic.
