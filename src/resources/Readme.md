### Detailed Breakdown

#### `/styles/globals.css`
- The `globals.css` file includes all the global CSS styles for the application. This file is responsible for:
  - Resetting default browser styles (if needed).
  - Defining common styles such as font sizes, line heights, base colors, etc.
  - Setting consistent margins, paddings, and other layout-related properties across all pages.

#### `/theme/theme.ts`
- The `theme.ts` file contains the theme configuration for Material UI (MUI) or any other design framework being used in the project. 
- It helps define the color palette, typography, and other reusable design tokens that can be applied throughout the application.
- If using MUI, this file might include:
  - Primary and secondary colors.
  - Breakpoints for responsive design.
  - Custom overrides for MUI components to maintain design consistency.

#### `/types/types.ts`
- This file contains TypeScript type definitions that are used across the project. 
- By storing common types here, you can ensure that type declarations are standardized and reused throughout different parts of the application.
- Examples of types defined here might include:
  - Global app-specific types, such as `User`, `AuthResponse`, or `APIResponse`.
  - Interface or type definitions that are commonly shared across components and services.

## How to Customize

- **Global Styles (`globals.css`)**: 
  - Modify this file to add any additional base styles for the app or override existing global styles.
  - Ensure that styles defined here are non-component-specific to maintain a clean separation of global styles and component-level styles.

- **Theme (`theme.ts`)**: 
  - Adjust color palettes, font families, and other design tokens here to match your branding or project requirements.
  - Extend the MUI theme or any other design systemâ€™s configuration to customize component behavior (e.g., button sizes, default margins).

- **Types (`types.ts`)**:
  - Add any new global types or interfaces that are reused across components to this file.
  - Keep type definitions centralized to avoid duplication across the project.

## Usage

- The global CSS is typically imported into your main entry point (e.g., `_app.tsx` in Next.js) to ensure it is applied site-wide.
- The theme file is passed into MUI's `ThemeProvider` (or a similar provider) to ensure the custom theme is applied to all components.
- The types file can be imported wherever you need to define or check for specific types and interfaces across the project.
