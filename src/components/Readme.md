# Component Structure

## ThemeProvider
This component wraps the application with a custom Material-UI theme and integrates the `AppRouterCacheProvider`.

### Considerations:
- Ensure that the theme from `@/resources/theme/theme` is correctly defined and exported.
- Place the `CssBaseline` outside of the children prop to maintain consistent styling across all components.

---

## ProductModal
This component is responsible for displaying product details in a modal.

### Improvements:
- **Error Handling**: Implement a retry mechanism for failed fetch requests, allowing users to attempt fetching data again.
- **Accessibility**: Add more descriptive `aria-` attributes to enhance accessibility for users with disabilities.
- **Optimization**: Ensure that the dependencies in `useEffect` are managed correctly to prevent unnecessary fetches.

---

## LongMenu
This component provides a dropdown menu with options related to products.

### Improvements:
- Consider adding `onClick` handlers to each `MenuItem` to enhance functionality.
- Dynamically generate menu items from an array to keep the code DRY, especially if they share similar structures.

---

## muiDataTableStylesProps
This utility function defines styles for a Material-UI data table.

### Considerations:
- Ensure that all styles conform to your design system for consistency across the application.
- Consider adding more specific styles for different table states (e.g., loading, empty) to improve usability.

---

## DataTable
This component manages the display of data in a table format, integrating fetching and pagination logic.

### Improvements:
- **Data Fetching**: Use `useEffect` for data fetching, with dependencies on the current page or other filter states as needed.
- **Loading States**: Implement a loading state that informs users while data is being fetched, thereby enhancing the user experience.
- **Modularization**: Break down the render logic into smaller components for better readability and maintainability.
